<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Volume" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/volume/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I wrote a program to manipulate the volume of an audio file. Specifically, I implemented a function that adjusts the volume of a WAV file by a given factor. The program reads an audio file in, modifies its amplitude, and writes the result to an output file.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub complies with CS50’s academic honesty policy.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input/Output</strong>: The program reads in a WAV audio file and writes the modified version to an output file.</li> <li><strong>Volume Adjustment</strong>: The program adjusts the volume of each sample in the audio file based on a user-provided scaling factor.</li> <li><strong>File Handling</strong>: It correctly handles the input and output of binary data (WAV file format).</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Command-line Input</strong>: The program takes three arguments: an input file, an output file, and a scaling factor for the volume.</li> <li><strong>Read Audio File</strong>: The program reads the audio file's headers and samples using binary input.</li> <li><strong>Adjust Volume</strong>: Each sample’s amplitude is multiplied by the scaling factor, effectively increasing or decreasing the volume.</li> <li><strong>Write Audio File</strong>: The modified samples are written to the output file, preserving the original file format and structure.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as the Makefile or sample audio files.</p>
